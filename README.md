# HTML email templates
Created several HTML email templates. 
Convert psd to html/css. 

Each template is a single HTML email built using Foundation for Emails. 
You can preview them and inspect the code to see how they were implemented, or download them and try making some changes.
Each template already has Foundation for Emails included in a style tag at the top of the file.

Get started:

1. You need Node.js installed on your computer.
2. Run cd <project> (for example: cmd -> cd C:\Coding\EmailsGetDoctor)
3. Then run: npm start (This will kick off the build process)

The final version HTML files for emails are compiled to a folder called "dist" (as in "distribution").
